## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Vanilla JavaScript SPA calling the Microsoft Graph.

## Scenario

1. The client Vanilla JavaScript SPA uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD B2C**.
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the Microsoft Graph protected **Azure AD B2C**.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run this sample.
- A modern web browser. This sample uses **ES6** conventions and will not run on **Internet Explorer**.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.
- An **Azure AD B2C** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD B2C** tenant.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-b2c-javascript-nodejs-management.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-c1s1
    npm install
```

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD B2C tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD B2C tenant.

### Register the spa app (ms-identity-javascript-c1s1)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-c1s1`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box.
   - For the *Redirect URI*, enter `https://<your_tenant_name>/ms-identity-javascript-c1s1`, replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your **Azure AD B2C** tenant.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Application permissions** section, select the **User.Read.All** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

1. At this stage, the permissions are assigned correctly but since the client app does not allow users to interact, the users' themselves cannot consent to these permissions.
   To get around this problem, we'd let the [tenant administrator consent on behalf of all users in the tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-admin-consent).
   Select the **Grant admin consent for {tenant}** button, and then select **Yes** when you are asked if you want to grant consent for the requested permissions for all account in the tenant. You need to be an the tenant admin to be able to carry out this operation.

#### Configure the spa app (ms-identity-javascript-c1s1) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `App\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ms-identity-javascript-c1s1` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"+$tenantName.
